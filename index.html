		<h4>What does "Full" in Full Stack Mean</h4>
		<p>
			Full means that you develop both the front end, and the back end. 
			The front end is what the user sees on what is called the client computer.
			The back end is what is on the server computer that delivers content to the front end.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>What does "stack" in full stack mean?</h4>
			<p>
				Stack Means that several Programs, a "stack" of programs is used.
				On the front end I use HTML 5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
				On the back end I use PHP, and MySQL.</p>
			<h4>What does 
				<a href="images/staonsping.png">
				"LAMP" stack
				</a> mean?</h4>
			<p>
				Lamp Stands for:
				L = Linux, which is the basis of our server operating system
				A = Apache, which is our web server
				M = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySql</a>, the database we use
				P = PHP, which is the programming laungage we use on the server side
			</p>
			<p>
				6. MySQL from the CLI (Command Line Interface) -- NTS, structure when done
				
				--The User Interface for DB's are HTML pages that WE create!
				--The CLI is where experts, where the Power Users can see inside of the DB
				but in a very primitive, non-GUI way. In other words, CLI is for the DB experts, 
				not the users.
